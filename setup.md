## Setting up your environment

- Create a directory called `swc-python`.
- Enter into that directory.
- Create a directory called `data`.

## Getting the data
The data we will be using is taken from the [gapminder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapminder_Foundation)
dataset. 

- From your browser, download [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://labsyspharm.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip).
- Find the file using your file explorere, and unzip the file into your `data` directory.
- Now, back in your terminal and enter the `data` directory.
