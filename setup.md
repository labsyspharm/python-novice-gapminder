## Installation Instructions
For all setup and installation instructions, please go
[here](https://labsyspharm.github.io/2019-10-02-python-programming/), and if 
you have questions, email us, slack us, or come to the Computational Forum.

## Setting up your environment

- Create a directory called `swc-python`.
- Enter into that directory (unless otherwise stated, we will assume you are in this directory).

## Getting the data
The data we will be using is taken from the [gapminder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapminder_Foundation)
dataset. 

- From your browser, download [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](https://labsyspharm.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip).
- Find the file using your file explorere, and unzip the file into your `swc-python` directory.
- There should now be a `data` directory within `swc-python`.
