## Python can be used as a simple calculator

*   The usual mathematical operations are supported
*   Two main kinds of number: `int` for integers, and `float` for numbers with decimals.
*   Exponents use `**`

~~~
In [1]: 1 + 3
Out[1]: 4

In [2]: 4 * 5
Out[2]: 20

In [3]: 1/2
Out[3]: 0.5

In [4]: 2**3
Out[4]: 8
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   The usual order of operations are obeyed

~~~
In [5]: 6/2 + 3 * 5**2
Out[5]: 78.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   You can also type arbitrary sequences of characters in quotes, called strings.
*   You can perform operations on those strings

~~~
In [6]: 'hello'
Out[6]: 'hello'

In [7]: 'hello' + 'world'
Out[7]: 'helloworld'

In [8]: 3 * 'hello'
OUt[8]: 'hellohellohello'
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Operations are generally intuitive.
*   Some do not work because they do not make sense

~~~
In [9]: 'hello' + 3
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-9-c9c9952ff2b4> in <module>
----> 1 'hello' + 3

TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
~~~
{: .error}
*   This is the first of many errors we will encounter in python.
*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
*   We will look at error messages in detail [later]({{ page.root }}/15-scope/#reading-error-messages).


## Use variables to store values.

*   **Variables** are names for values.
*   In Python the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the name on the left.
*   The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.
*   Here, Python assigns an age to a variable `age`
    and a name in quotes to a variable `first_name`.

~~~
In [1]: age = 42

In [2]: first_name = 'Ahmed'
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Variable names
    * can **only** contain letters, digits, and underscore `_` (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
    * cannot start with a digit
*   Variable names that start with underscores like `__alistairs_real_age` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

## Use `print` to display values in the midst of your script.

*   Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
*   Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
*   Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
*   To add a string to the printout, wrap the string in single or double quotes.
*   The values passed to the function are called **arguments**

~~~
In [3]: print(first_name, 'is', age, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Ahmed is 42 years old
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
*   And wraps around to a new line at the end.
*   Also note the lack of quotes around the strings.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error. (Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.)

~~~
In [1]: last_name
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-e1aeda7b4fde> in <module>
----> 1 last_name

NameError: name 'last_name' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}


## Variables can be used in calculations.

*   We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
    *   Remember, we assigned the value `42` to `age` a few lines ago.

~~~
age = age + 3
age
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
45
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

*   The characters (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string are
    ordered. For example, the string `'AB'` is not the same as `'BA'`. Because of
    this ordering, we can treat the string as a list of characters.
*   Each position in the string (first, second, etc.) is given a number. This
    number is called an **index** or sometimes a subscript.
*   Indices are numbered from 0.
*   Use the position's index in square brackets to get the character at that
    position.
    
![an illustration of indexing](../fig/2_indexing.svg)

~~~
atom_name = 'helium'
atom_name[0]
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
'h'
~~~
{: .output}

## Use a slice to get a substring.

*   A part of a string is called a **substring**. A substring can be as short as a
    single character.
*   An item in a list is called an element. Whenever we treat a string as if it
    were a list, the string's elements are its individual characters.
*   A slice is a part of a string (or, more generally, any list-like thing).
*   We take a slice by using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is replaced with the
    index of the first element we want and `stop` is replaced with the index of
    the element just after the last element we want.
*   Mathematically, you might say that a slice selects `[start:stop)`.
*   The difference between `stop` and `start` is the slice's length.
*   Taking a slice does not change the contents of the original string. Instead,
    the slice is a copy of part of the original string.

~~~
atom_name = 'sodium'
atom_name[0:3]
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
'sod'
~~~
{: .output}

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

~~~
len('helium')
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
6
~~~
{: .output}

*   Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
     like in mathematics.

## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.
