## Running an `ipython` session

- Ipython is a common and very powerful way to test small pieces of python
code.

- It is also the basis for many other python tools such as Jupyter and is
emulated in many other environments, such as IDEs.

- To run `ipython`, first enter your terminal, then simply type:

~~~
$ ipython
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and you should see a prompt like this, but more colorful:

~~~
Python 3.6.6 (default, Sep 19 2018, 12:51:03)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 6.5.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help. 

In [1]: 
~~~
{: .output}

- To exit the `ipython`, type `exit` and hit enter.
